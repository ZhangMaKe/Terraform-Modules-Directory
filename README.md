# Terraform Modules Directory (Informational)

[![Modules Directory](https://img.shields.io/badge/Modules-DIRECTORY-blue.svg)](./MODULES_DIRECTORY.md)

This repository contains an automatically generated reference of Terraform modules published under the GitHub account `ZhangMaKe`.

Important: this repository is not a library or toolkit to be installed or reused. It is a centralized, read-only listing of module repositories and metadata intended to help users discover and link to the actual module repositories hosted under the `ZhangMaKe` account.

## Purpose

To provide an index ([`MODULES_DIRECTORY.md`](./MODULES_DIRECTORY.md)) of Terraform modules built and maintained by ZhangMaKe containing names, descriptions, and links to the individual repositories that contain the modules.

## What you will find here

- [`MODULES_DIRECTORY.md`](./MODULES_DIRECTORY.md) — the generated Markdown table listing module name, description, and link.
- `.github/workflows/directory-generator.yml` — the GitHub Actions workflow that builds [`MODULES_DIRECTORY.md`](./MODULES_DIRECTORY.md) on a schedule and on demand.

## Not a module registry or source of artifacts

This repository does not contain module code or releases. To use any module, follow the link provided in the table to the module's repository and use the module from that repository directly (e.g., via registry address or Git source as documented in the module's README).

## For users: how to find and use a module

1. Open [`MODULES_DIRECTORY.md`](./MODULES_DIRECTORY.md) in this repository and look for the module you need.
2. Click the "Link" for the module to open its repository.
3. Read the module's README in its repository for usage, inputs, outputs, examples, and versioning information.

## License & ownership

All module code remains in each module's repository. This index is maintained by the `ZhangMaKe` account. If you want to reuse or republish content, check each module's own license in its repository.
